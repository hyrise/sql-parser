Preamble

The Hasso-Plattner-Institut für Softwaresystemtechnik GmbH, Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-
Strasse 2-3, 14482 Potsdam, hereinafter referred to as Hasso-Plattner

1. Licence Grant

With these terms of use, the Hasso-Plattner Institute grants everyone, free of
charge, a non-exclusive right of use (§ 32(3)(3) Copyright Act) in HYRISE. It
therefore makes an offer to everyone to conclude a corresponding licence
agreement for the grant of exploitation rights in accordance with these terms
of use. The express acceptance by the Hasso-Plattner Institute need not be
received by the user (§ 151 German Civil Code).  The above rule means that the
user cannot assign the right of use ac-quired by it in accordance with these
terms of use to a third party, but that the third party acquires the rights
directly from Hasso-Plattner Institute.

        Point 2, though these terms of use only apply to the part of the new 
        computer program so created which is HYRISE where the combination does 
        not result in a change pursuant to Point 2.b). In the latter case, 
        these terms of use apply to the entire new computer program.

        as well as to include a copy of these terms of use; in the case of 
        publication, the terms of use must also be included in the offer of

        to the public via the Internet; for the case that the user combines 
        HYRISE pursuant to Point 2 d) with another computer program, it must 
        ensure in any offer of the same that HYRISE is also included in this 
        entire program and that this is only used in accordance with these 
        terms of use.

        due to legal defects or absence of warranted qualities as well as for 
        injury to life, body and health. Liability for initial inability, 
        delay and impossibility shall be limited to such damage typically 
        foreseeable of such a computer program.

        specific character and in which the user may trust (cardinal duty). In 
        case of breach of a cardinal obligation, the liability limit for 
        initial inability in accordance with a) shall apply mutatis mutandis.
